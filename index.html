            <p1>
                I am a 24 year old Nigerian. I live and work in Midtown Atlanta. I love to travel and am obsessed
                with Harry
                Potter. I have lived in 7 different cities in the US in the 8 years that I have been here. I speak 2
                languages
                (English and French), and understand 2 others (Yoruba and Bini).
                <br>
                <br>
                I have a BA in Industrial
                Psychology from the University of Kentucky, and a MS in Business Communications from Spalding
                University in Louisville, Kentucky.
                I have a background in HR and worked for 2 years with Huamana, Inc. I currently work for BlackRock
                (the world's largest investment management firm) as a recruiting coordinator for our campus
                recruiting program. Specifically, I coordinate the recruiting of software engineers into our Summer
                Analyst and Program Analyst classes.
                <br>
                <br>
                Working with software engineers and learning about their needs and work projects got me interested
                in the field. BlackRock is also a FinTech company and technology in general is a huge part of what
                we do. The more I thought about this, the more I realized that I owed it to myself to learn a little
                more about this field. It would not only help me be better at my role, but it would also give me the
                flexibility to pursue a different career if I so chose.
                Moving to Atlanta and working out of the office located on Georgia Tech's campus gave me the
                opportunity to enroll in Georgia Tech's coding bootcamp.
                My hope is to gain some knowledge that I would be able to use in my current role, and my career
                going forward.
